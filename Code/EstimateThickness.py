"""
Estimate the lens edge thickness using a measurement and user inputs.

User Interaction:
1. Specify .nms measurement file path
2. Do until satisfactory results are achieved:
a) user inputs edge lines (more details shown on execution) so they overlay with the edges
b) edge profile and thickness plots
3. Thickness is displayed
